# C Programs
These are programs that I made when I first learned about programming. I wrote these programs in my initial C Programming classes in college. Here is a list and explanation of what each of them do:

#game.c
This includes 2 games. An arithmetic and guessing game. The arithmetic game quizzes you on your addition or multiplication skills. The guessing game has you type in a number between 1 and 100 and it will tell you higher or lower until you guess the correct number.

#tic-tac-toe.c
This is a simple command line interface tic tac toe game. It allows the user to input the square they would like to mark, and the game checks if there is a winner or draw after each turn.
